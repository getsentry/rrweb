## 1.100.0

This release marks the first `@sentry-internal/rr*` release of our forked packages.
Note: These packages are supposed to be used internally by other Sentry projects.
We do not provide support or make any guarantees in terms of breaking changes.

We're starting releasing our forked packages with version `1.100.0`, as this gives us enough headroom over
possible future rrweb v1.x patches while still staying in sync with the rrweb major version.
